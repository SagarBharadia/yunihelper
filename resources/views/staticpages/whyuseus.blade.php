		<h1>Why Use Us</h1>
		<p>Now comes the make or break question, why use us? To put it blunt, we aren't a large corperation who think we're better than everyone else! We ourselves are university students who probably understand the university life currently more than others. We will use your feedback to improve the service and hopefully create a all in one tool to help you manage your life throughout university! We will read your feedback and emails (however many there are) as we value what you, the user, has to say!</p>
		<p>This being said, we are university students and this project was also created to help begin our portfolio! We do place advertisments, 1 per page on the dashboard to help pay for the servers we use which are currently $5 / Â£3.82 a month. We kindly request you do not use a adblocker on our website to help us pay for the services we require to run this service!</p>
		<div class="align-left" id="whyUseUs-features">
			<h2 class="text-underline">Features</h2>
			<h3>Notes</h3>
			<p>Using our notes storing system you can write up your notes online and access them from anywhere! Yes even from your mobile (this is the 21st century, you thought we wouldn't be responsive?!)</p>
			<h3>Assignments</h3>
			<p>With the assignments service you are able to keep track of the assignments you have and haven't done letting you easily manage your assignments ensuring you dont miss any, and if you do, better get cracking and get them in!</p>
			<h3>Finance</h3>
			<p>Using our financial management system, you can track your purchases easily and with our soon to oome budgeting tool you'll be able to do even more. Don't worry, we dont ask you for your banking details to use this feature, you just have to be honest with yourself! (responsibilities a scare, we know!)</p>
			<h3>ToDo List</h3>
			<p>Who doesn't love a good ol' todo list? Easy to use, easy to see, great for quick small tasks that you need to remember to get done!</p>

		<h3>Your feature could be here! Got a idea that you would like to see us develop and add? Let us know! We will take a look at the idea and let you know whether it is pheasable for us to implement (more than likely it will be, fingers crossed!)</h3>
