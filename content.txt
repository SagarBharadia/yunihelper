-----ORGANISATION-----
ABOUT US
What started as a small project to learn a new framework, led to a fully fledged application which helps manages your university experience. We are a small team, two to be precise, who have pride in this application and will be constantly developing it upon the feedback received and features you, the users, suggest!

-----PRODUCT-----
WHY USE US
Now comes the make or break question, why use us? To put it blunt, we aren't a large corperation who think we're better than everyone else! We ourselves are university students who probably understand the university life currently more than others. We will use your feedback to improve the service and hopefully create a all in one tool to help you manage your life throughout university! We will read your feedback and emails (however many there are) as we value what you, the user, has to say!

This being said, we are university students and this project was also created to help begin our portfolio! We do place advertisments, 1 per page on the dashboard to help pay for the servers we use which are currently $5 / Â£3.82 a month. We kindly request you do not use a adblocker on our website to help us pay for the services we require to run this service!
